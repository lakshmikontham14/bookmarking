        <P >The childhood of Nick Vujicic was not a very good one I'd like to say that he had a very nice childhood and his life was great but I cannot because it was far from it. The moment that he was born his parents were absolutely 
            shocked to see that their son had no arms or legs. His father (Boris Vujicic)was so distraught that he left the hospital room to vomit and his mother (Duska Vujicic) couldn't bring herself to hold Nick for a long 4 months, imagine 
            yourself as a child and having your mother refusing to even touch you. After a time his parents got over their emotional distress and tried to do their best for their son Nick. According to NIck, had he been born in a third world country, 
            his condition might have been considered a curse or a shame by his parents and he might have been killed at birth. He was born in Melbourne, Australia and later moved to Brisbane, Australia where he lived for 14 years before he moved to California. 
            His parents decided not to send him to a school for kids with disabilities and they sent him to a mainstream school instead. At the age of 8 Nick didn't see a very good future ahead of him and at the age of 10 he attempted to drown himself in the bathtub 
            but after several attempts he realised that he did not want to burden his loved ones with the guilt and sadness of his death. When he was 15 he sealed his faith in God and from there he started to think of the things he had instead of what he did not.
             When he was in high school he met a janitor who inspired him to start speaking his faith and overcoming his adversity at the age of 17</P><hr>

        <p>Nick Vujicic was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, in December 4, 1982, without arms and legs—a rare congenital disorder called “phocomelia.” His mother, Dusanka Vujicic, was a former pediatric nurse, while his father, Borislav Vujicic, worked for business management. Both were active devotees in Melbourne Church. Also a midwife, his mother had done best what every mother must do. Yet during delivery, Nick was born with neither legs nor arms, but little did they know, their son will someday be the message of hope, and will touch the lives of millions of people.
            Nick struggled and learned to do things even with deformed arms and legs. He was the first handicap student who was permitted to attend a normal school in Australia. Even so, he was still bullied, laughed at, and considered different. Life for Nick was unfair that when he was only eight years old, he thought of committing suicide as an escape from his loneliness.</p><hr>
        <h2 id="The life without limits">The life without limits</h2>
        <p>Nick Vujicic’s life was a constant battle of self-acceptance and grief, but his mother made him realize that his imperfection is a perfect inspiration to others. It was his life’s turning point where his mother showed him a piece of article from a newspaper about a man who’s still happy even with disability. Nick then understood that life without limbs doesn’t mean a life without purpose.
            By the age of seventeen, Nick Vujicic had the chance to lead a speech at his prayer group. The young Nick met friends that also inspired him to continue his journey. With God’s grace and Nick’s perseverance, he graduated from Griffith University at the age of twenty-one with a double major in finance and accounting.</p> <hr>
        <h2 id="The unstoppable faith and love">The unstoppable faith and love</h2>
        <p>As of today, Nick Vujicic is a best-selling author, evangelist, and well sought motivational speaker all over the world, even without limbs. His extraordinary story is a cure to hopelessness and the harbinger of unstoppable love and faith. Just as his father would tell him, “You are a gift, just differently packaged.” With over 6 million people in 57 countries, Nick shared his message of hope and Jesus’s good news through his own life.
            Nick Vujicic married Kanae Miyahara, and they were given a normal baby boy they named Kyoshi James, then a second son, Dejan Levi. In 2015, Nick received a prestigious award as the “Young Australian of the Year” for his effort in enlightening other’s faith and hope. He believes that if you change your attitude, you can change your life.
            Currently Nick Vujicic promotes a non-profit organization and ministry called Life Without Limbs (founded in 2005) and Attitude is Altitude (founded in 2007) to share news of good faith and positive change to everyone. He published several books, including Life Without Limits: Inspiration of a Ridiculously Good Life (2010), Unstoppable: The Incredible Power of Faith in Action (2013), Love Without Limits (2016), and many more. He also starred in a short film, The Butterfly Circus.
            Through motivational speeches, live events, and inspirational resources, the life of Nick Vujicic “a man with no limbs,” will still remain a heart-warming story worth sharing for hundreds of generations to come.</p><hr>

        <p>Today, he is one of the greatest motivational speakers on the earth inspiring millions to never give up on their dreams and god’s vision.
            In 2005, he established an NGO named, Life Without Limbs, with a motive to surpass the barriers that people confront and to introduce them to Lord Jesus, who has a purpose for everyone. He wishes to connect people to Jesus by praying with them and for them so that everyone can start living their own life without limits.
            As Nick himself has experienced nightmares while he was bullied by his friends, he launched an initiative named “Attitude Is Altitude “ in which he teaches students how to make good changes in their lives and communities.
            The way he became a painter, swimmer, skydiver, writer, entrepreneur, actor, and so on demonstrates that fear is the biggest disability than physical impairment, as it always limits ur mind and diverts it from your goal.</p>
